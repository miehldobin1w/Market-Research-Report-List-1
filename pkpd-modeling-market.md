<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PK/PD Modeling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Connection to PK/PD Model</li><li>Indirect Connection PK/PD Model</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PK/PD modeling in the pharmaceutical market can be categorized into two types: direct and indirect connections. Direct connection markets involve products with a clear, quantifiable relationship between pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), allowing for precise dosing and drug efficacy predictions. Indirect connection markets, however, utilize PK/PD models to inform broader therapeutic strategies or population-level effects, focusing more on general trends and insights rather than specific dose-response relationships. Both types aid in drug development and regulatory decision-making.</p></p>

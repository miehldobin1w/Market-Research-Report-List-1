<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External</li><li>Internal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation therapy is categorized into two primary market types: external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy). EBRT directs high-energy beams, like X-rays or protons, from outside the body to target tumors, making it non-invasive and suitable for various cancer types. In contrast, internal radiation therapy involves placing radioactive sources directly inside or near the tumor, allowing for high doses with minimal impact on surrounding tissues. Both methods play crucial roles in cancer treatment, enhancing patient outcomes.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organ Storage Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Storage Solution</li><li>Perfusion Storage Solution</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The organ storage solution market is segmented into two main types: static storage solutions and perfusion storage solutions. Static storage solutions involve preserving organs at low temperatures, relying on a cold ischemia environment to minimize metabolic activity. In contrast, perfusion storage solutions actively circulate a preservation solution through the organ, enhancing nutrient supply and waste removal. This dynamic approach aims to extend the viability of organs for transplantation, improving outcomes and expanding the donor organ pool significantly.</p></p>

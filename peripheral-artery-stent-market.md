<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Artery Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drug-eluting Stent</li><li>Bare Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peripheral artery stent market is primarily categorized into drug-eluting stents and bare stents. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication that is gradually released to prevent artery narrowing or re-blockage, enhancing long-term outcomes. In contrast, bare stents are metal frameworks that provide structural support without a coating, making them simpler and potentially less costly. Both types are used to treat peripheral artery disease by restoring blood flow, but they differ in their mechanisms for preventing complications post-implantation.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Human DNA Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Protein Vaccine</li><li>Gene-Based Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The human DNA vaccines market is primarily divided into two types: recombinant protein vaccines and gene-based vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines utilize engineered proteins derived from pathogens to stimulate an immune response, often requiring boosters for long-lasting immunity. In contrast, gene-based vaccines deliver genetic material encoding antigenic proteins directly into cells, prompting the body to produce its own immune response. Both types aim to enhance vaccine efficacy and safety, offering innovative approaches to prevent infectious diseases and improve overall public health.</p></p>
